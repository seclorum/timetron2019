*here we present a collection of archaic and outmoded computers - the kind that just don't get used any more - now doing interesting and modern things.*

an old computer never really perishes - as long as there is a user who cares to maintain it. it is the user that makes a computer useful - not just the machine itself.

it is 2019: lets see what these old machines are still capable of doing.  and lets explore some of the systems that didn't make it into the mainstream - could we be running BeOS on our macbooks?  might we have had an SGI in our pocket? what was it like before the 21st century arrived and the world of computing became all about iUSers and pocket robots ..

did you know there are still programmers releasing interesting and entertaining apps for really old computers? you know the kind .. perhaps stashed away in the attic somewhere. still operational.  dusty, to be sure - yet still just as fun as ever.  computers for which *the only walled garden is the willpower to plug it in, boot it up, and do something with it*.
