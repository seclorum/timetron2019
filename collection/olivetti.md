# olivetti m10

*still considered by serious authors and writers to be a distraction-free writing platform of high value, the olivetti m10 is an ultra-minimal computing platform.  we expand on it and make it an even mightier machine to cart around with one small trick: we add an integrated raspberry-pi and put a copy of wikipedia onboard while we're at it ..*

# demo

turn the machine on, and follow the instructions.
