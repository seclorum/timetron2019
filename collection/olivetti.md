# olivetti m10

 considered by serious authors and other diligent raconteurs to be a distraction-free writing platform of high distinction, the olivetti m10 is also an ultra-minimal computing platform.

 we expand on the simplicity of this m10 and make it an even mightier machine to cart around with one small trick: by adding an integrated raspberry-pi, and putting a copy of wikipedia onboard while we're at it ..

# demo

turn the machine on, and follow the instructions.
