# sgi o2

this humble o2 will give you a glimpse into what is now a dinosaur of computing. 

while this class of machines were once considered 'powerhouse' computers, your watch is probably more powerful than this system, these days.. 

nevertheless, our o2 has dinosaurs.. fly around and find them!

for the duration of the exhibit, we'll also use this o2 for other things.  if you'd like to have an account for the fun of playing with whats onboard, just leave us a message.

# demo

this is a unix system.  you know this!  :)
