# zx spectrum

in terms of sheer quantity and availability of software titles, the zx spectrum is one of the greatest 8-bit machines from an era when, if you wanted to play a game or try to do something useful, you either had to type the program in yourself, or copy a cassette from a friend, borrow your sisters tape-deck and wire it up, press play, go off and do something else for 30 minutes, come back and see if the program had started ..

in spite of all that, this machine is still very widely regarded and continues to get new software written for it - and hardware accessories too, so - thankfully - we've been able to add some modern technology to our spectrum that makes it pretty much load software in an instant.

here we indulge in a bit of nostalgia for the classics and as well show some of the latest software releases for the zx spectrum: a true legend of the 8-bit era.

# demo

turn the machine on and follow the instructions.
