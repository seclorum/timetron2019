# zx spectrum

*another great 8-bit machine from an era when if you wanted to play a game you either had to type it in yourself, or copy a cassette from a friend.. thankfully, we've added some modern technology to our spectrum, which means we can easily show you the latest releases - 30 years after the demise of the machine - from an active and enthusiastic developer community ...*

# demo

turn the machine on, and follow the instructions.
