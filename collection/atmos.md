# oric atmos


a personal favourite of our curator, the oric atmos is one of those machines from the 80's that came and went in a blink of an eye.  but yet, now it is 2019 .. and there are still titles being written for this cute little machine, quirks and all. 

here we delight in seeing just how far things have come, 30+ years after this short-lived machines demise on the mainstream market.  a selection of old classics as well as some astonishing new hits await the avid oric user ..
