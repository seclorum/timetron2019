# atari portfolio

the atari portfolio was one of the first pocketable computers that you could actually use to do useful things - although is probably most easily recognized as the hacker terminal deployed by John Conner to collect cash from an ATM machine so as to escape the Terminator.  not that doing so wouldn't be useful, were it necessary..

this portfolio still lives and is as useful a tool as ever, since it has a C compiler.  so we used it to make some small games, which you can play. maybe we'll wire it up to the matrix, also.

# demo

turn the machine on and follow the instructions.
