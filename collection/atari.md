# atari portfolio

*the atari portfolio was one of the first pocketable computers that you could actually use to do things ..  but is probably most famous as the hacker terminal used by John Conner to collect cash from an ATM machine so as to escape the Terminator.*

*the portfolio fits in a special place in nerd lore - unattainable - atari folded shortly after its release - yet desired as an object which hinted at an alternative future - where atari still lived, and was as useful a tool against oppression as any toy of the rebellion.*

# demo

# exhibit period
