# amstrad cpc6128

with one of the more boisterous and adventurous contemporary developer communities to be found in the retro-revival scene, and widely considered by the cognescenti to be technically one of the best-designed machines of the 8-bit era, the amstrad cpc6128 continues to delight. 

here we present an upgraded system, capable of using USB storage - and for the fun of it, we've filled the stick with all of the submitted entries in the CPC RetroDev competition for 2018.  we'll also run the 2019 titles relased so far, if we can find them..

# demo
turn the machine on, select the disk image to be loaded using the knob, and then mount the image by pressing the knob.  use CAT and RUN" commands to get started.
