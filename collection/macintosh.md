# macintosh powerbook


the first of apples laptops to feature a trackpad, this is an ancient ancestor of the modern macbook.

here we present a set of HYPERCARD stacks for your entertainment - lest we forget what the web could have been, perhaps .. if the internet had arrived just a few years earlier on macintosh and it had somehow gotten wired up to HYPERCARD.

its probably fair to say that there is some genetic material from HYPERCARD in the modern web-browser.  

# demo

explore the HYPERCARD stacks we have left for you on the desktop.
